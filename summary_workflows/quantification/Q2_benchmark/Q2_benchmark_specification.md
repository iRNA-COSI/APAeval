# Q2 benchmark specification

## Synopsis

Benchmark to test correlation between RNAseq-based poly(A) site quantification and poly(A)-sites quantification based on orthogonal 3'end seq data.

Input data:

1. Poly(A) sites quantification based on RNAseq data using the benchmarked tool
2. Poly(A) sites quantification based on orthogonal 3'end-seq dataset

Based on the input data the following metrics are computed:
 
1. Correlation between RNAseq-based quantification and 3'end-seq quantification.

To compute the metrics, the poly(A) sites identified from the RNAseq data using the benchmarked tool and from the orthogonal dataset should be first mapped to each other:

- find multiple ground truth sites overlapping one predicted site
  - weights are added for the predicted site based on distance to the ground truth site
  - expression can be calculated by `weight_i*expression_i` for all prediction sites having the same ground truth site assigned
- find multiple predicted sites overlapping one ground truth site
  - weigths are added for the predicted sites based on distance to the ground truth site
  - expression can be calculated by `sum(weight_i*expression_i)` to get a single value matching the one ground truth site OR just summed without considering weight


## General info

* **Challenge:** Quantification
* **Identifier:** Q2

## Inputs

| # | Format | Link | Example data |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | BED | [Specification][spec-bed] | [Link][in1] |
| 2 | BED | [Specification][spec-bed] | [Link][in2] |

### Additional info inputs

#### Format 1

This BED file contains genomic positions of unique cleavage/polyadenylation sites as well as TPM values for each identified site quantified from RNAseq data by the benchmarked tool.  
Fields:

- **chrom** - the name of the chromosome
- **chromStart** - the starting position of the feature in the chromosome; this corresponds to the nucleotide just upstream of the cleavage and polyadenylation reaction; the starting position is 0-based, i.e. the first base on the chromosome is numbered 0
- **chromEnd** - the ending position of the feature in the chromosome; as identified PAS are single-nucleotide, the ending position is equal to `chromStart + 1`
- **name** - defines the name of the identified poly(A) site
- **score** - the TPM value - quantified PAS
- **strand** - defines the strand; either "." (=no strand) or "+" or "-"

#### Format 2

This BED file contains genomic positions of unique unique cleavage/polyadenylation sites as well as TPM values for each identified site quantified from the orthogonal 3'end-seq dataset.
Fields are the same as in format 1.
