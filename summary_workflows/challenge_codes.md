# Challenge codes

>WIP: This page is a work in progress, the final challenge codes have not been decided on yet. Please come back later, or sign up for helping us to structure the challenges ;)

## Input to summary workflows

Input to summary workflows must be in the form of:

`CHALLENGECODE/PARTICIPANT/CHALLENGECODE_PARTICIPANT_OUTCODE.ext`

Example: AA/MISO/AA_MISO_01.bed

`CHALLENGECODE` is described here. For more information on naming scheme refer to the [execution workflow README][ex_readme].
