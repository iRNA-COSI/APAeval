# PR review guide for execution workflows
(If you don't really know what to look for when reviewing a PR)

When browsing the pull requests, watch out for the `Ready for review` tag; here reviews are needed. If you come across `Reviews to address` there has already been at least one review, and some changes have to be done to the code. You could still review, or wait until this label disappears, or you address the suggestions yourself. In the latter case, do communicate this on slack and in the pull request comments, to avoid several people getting in each other's way.    
At least 2 independent reviews are required before merging a PR.


## Start with the README of the execution workflow

- Try and follow the instructions as they are to run the pipeline (using the test data in `tests/test_data`)
(Most workflows should have configs and sample-sheets set up to use this data anyway)

- Note anything that’s unclear - following (not exhaustive) should be obvious 
    - Format of required input data
    - Layout of sample sheet and what the columns mean (there should be an example)
    - Output files produced (names, what they contain)

## Check the output data matches our specifications

Specifications are here at `exeuction_workflows/execution_output_specification.md`


## Check that steps to run tools/pre-processing are wrapped in Dockerfiles

- Should be uploaded to apaeval team Dockerhub, not on personal accounts 
- If needs uploading, ping Yuk-Kei or Alex pointing towards commit ID with Dockerfile (which builds locally)


## Code organisation & general comments
- Stages of pipeline should (ideally) do one thing
    - E.g. separate scripts to run tool and to generate APAeval output files

- No hardcoding of parameters or output filenames (make them adjustable via a config file)

- Sample sheet should contain sample specific info, pipeline specific info should go in config

- Custom annotation files should be generated by the workflow and not be downloaded (e.g. from UCSC Genome Browser, tool’s Github repo etc.)
    - If ‘gene model’ or BED12 format required, use the ‘GTF to BED12’ utility in the utils/ folder

- Output files from test data shouldn’t be committed with the repository

- Make sure (custom) code is clearly documented with comments explaining functions etc.
