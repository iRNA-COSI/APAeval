# Execution workflow for LABRAT

`LABRAT` is for quantifying the alternative usage of polyadenylation and cleavage sites in RNAseq data. You can find the [publication on BioRXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.05.326702v1).
source code: https://github.com/TaliaferroLab/LABRAT

## Input & pre-processing
- samplesheet.csv with the following columns (more_samplesheets/samplesheet_paired.csv was used for testing locally)
  - sample -- unique names of the samples
  - fastq1 -- single-end fastq or paired-end fastq1
  - fastq2 -- paired-end fastq2 (if single-end, please leave it empty)
  - gff -- gencode gff file (tested Ensembl does not work due to the lack of the gene_type field)
  - fasta -- genome fasta file 
  - condition -- condition of the samples (requires at least two conditions)

## Params

- `--input` samplesheet.csv 
- `--conditionA` the first condition in the condition column of the samplesheet.csv
- `--conditionB` the second condition in the condition column of the samplesheet.csv

## Output & post-processing

`LABRAT` consists of the following three steps:
- `makeTFfasta` -- makes a fasta file of transcripts that will later be quantified by salmon
- `runSalmon` -- quantifies transcript abudance with salmon (please see Notes below)
   - each sample will have its own output directory
   - `quant.sf` is used for generating the quantification bed file but without `chromStart` and `chromEnd` inforamtion (the starting and ending position of the feature in the chromosome.)
- `calculatepsi` -- calculates the ùúì values for each gene in each sample and the identify genes that show significantly different ùúì values across conditions.
   - The output `LABRAT.psis.pval` is used for generation the differential usage tsv file

## Notes

The `LABRAT.py --mode runSalmon` step is replaced by running `salmon` directly with the [`salmon index`](https://github.com/TaliaferroLab/LABRAT/blob/73b9ddd6b7922a349419b49b2ed25e93e9f261f0/LABRAT.py#L877) and [`salmon quant` commands indicated in `LABRAT.py`](https://github.com/TaliaferroLab/LABRAT/blob/73b9ddd6b7922a349419b49b2ed25e93e9f261f0/LABRAT.py#L354) due to c++ compling problems of salmon in LABRAT's BioContainer.
