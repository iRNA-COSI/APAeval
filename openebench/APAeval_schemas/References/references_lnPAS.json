	"bibliographic_ids":["doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.InPAS"],
	"abstract": "Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is one of the important post- transcriptional regulation mechanisms which occurs in most human genes. InPAS facilitates the discovery of novel APA sites and the differential usage of APA sites from RNA-Seq data. It leverages cleanUpdTSeq to fine tune identified APA sites by removing false sites."
